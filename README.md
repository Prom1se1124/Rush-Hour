Horizontal vehicles can only move left and right. Vertical vehicles can only move up and down.
4. The score will count how many pieces are selected and moved. 
Merely selecting and deselecting a piece should not count as a move, and multiple consecutive moves of the same piece should count as only one move.
Lower scores are better!
